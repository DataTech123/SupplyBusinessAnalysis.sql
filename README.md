This supply database is designed by myself. It mainly focuses on a supply business analytics project for querying in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Its purpose is to benefit tracking all transaction records from supply systems to monitor supply use, payment status, and stock levels in warehouses.
The SQL statements consist of comprehensive queries as follows:

Part 1: CTE (Common Table Expression) query for the total purchase from each supplier.

Part 2: Combination of two CTEs to query purchase items and stock in each warehouse.

Part 3: A summary of the main query that combines CTEs to fetch the total purchase amount, payment status, and inventory tracking in each warehouse.

Data Explanatory: This is just one example of my SQL coding skills. In this case scenario,it will be connected to internal company software and data warehouses for specific, complex business system data extractions. At some point, I can collaborate with other team colleagues on any job tasks by using third-party company tools and software as well.

Thank you so much for your review and questions for further development.
